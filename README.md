## Description

The Academy Awards, or the Oscars, are awards given since 1929 to honor artistic achievements in film and movies. Although they are an American Awards Ceremony, the Academy Awards are considered one of the most prestigious awards in film entertainment worldwide.

Like any nearly 100 year old institution, the Academy Awards have undergone many changes. Some award categories have been renamed, merged, or discontinued altogether. Movies  and actors that were cultural phenomenons have been reduced bar trivia questions. To keep all of this information straight, I have decided to lay it all out in an easy, searchable database, one that is scalable and reusable.

I will be working with information taken directly from the Academy Awards website, and I hope that this API will be a living document, updating as new awards happen. I also hope that it can be public, available for non-commercial use.

##### User Stories
<details>
    <summary><span style="color:red"><strong>Expand to Read User Stories</strong></summary>
1. User needs to be able to use program.
2. This will get filled in later I assume.

</details>


## Setup/Installation Requirements

<details>
    <summary>Required Programs</summary>
    
1. An internet browser.
2. Visual Code Studio (or another code editor).
3. .NET

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Installation of Program</summary>

1. Open the terminal on your local machine and navigate to "Desktop."
2. Clone <b>Academy Award API</b> with the following git command `git clone https://github.com/GBProductions/Epicodus-Capstone`
3. Navigate to the top level of the repository with the command `cd Epicodus-Capstone`
4. In the CL, type in `git init`.

    <summary>Configuration</summary>

### AppSettings

#### Instructions: `appsettings.json` Creation

1. Create a file in the root directory called `appsettings.json`. 
2. Add `appsettings.json` to `.gitignore`. Commit change in GIT.
3. Insert the following code into `appsettings.json`:
    
``` 
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning",
      "System": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Information"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=oscar_api;uid=root;[YOUR-PASSWORD];"
  }
}

```

4. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with password you selected when installing MySQLWorkbench.
5. Replace database name with the name of your database (if necessary).
6. Replace port name with the port of your choice (if necessary).
7. In the root directory, run `dotnet ef databse update` 
8. In the root directory, run `dotnet ef databse restore`

This will recreate the database on your computer, using MySQLWorkbench. You can proceed to Startup.

## API Exploration

![An SQL table showing the Oscar_API schema. A table named Awards has the fields "id" and "Academy Awards." The "id" field is connected to a field "NominationId" which is in the table Nominations. Nominations has the fields "NominationID", "Nominee", "Film", "Year", "Category", "CategoryActive", "Winner", and "Notes".](./OscarAPI/img/Oscar_API-Schema.png "OscarAPI Schema")

### Swagger
To explore Academy Award API with Swagger - Swashbuckle, go to your program directory and launch the program with `dotnet run`. Once the program is running, open a browser window and go to `http://localhost:5000/swagger`, and you will be able to navigate and have full CRUD functionality.

### Searching via Parameters
In order to search for animals matching a parameter, use this format:

```
GET /api/Nominations?{parameter}={search-term}

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
